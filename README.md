# âš¡Zap

Zap is a minimal `zsh` plugin manager

## Install

```sh
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zap-zsh/zap/master/install.sh)
```

## Uninstall

```sh
rm -rf .local/share/zsh
```

## Notes

Will only work with plugins that are named conventionally, this means that the plugin file is the same name as the repository with `.plugin.zsh` appended.

For example: [vim](https://github.com/zap-zsh/vim)
